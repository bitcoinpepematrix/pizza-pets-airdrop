# Pizza Pets Airdrop Partnerships
Pizza Pets is excited to announce a new airdrop partnership model that embodies our core values of fairness, transparency, and community support.

Here’s a detailed look into the inspiration, how to qualify, allocation amounts, and verification methods.

### 1. Inspiration
The Pizza Pets Airdrop Partnership is founded on four core principles:

1. **Fair & Transparent:** We strive to ensure that every aspect of the airdrop is fair and transparent, building trust within our community.
2. **Support All Active Communities:** We aim to back as many communities as we can, promoting a diverse and vibrant ecosystem. This includes projects outside Bitcoin Ordinals.
3. **Reciprocal Support:** We believe in supporting projects that, in turn, support us, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship.
4. **Empower Our Builders:** We're committed to supporting our holders who are developing and growing their own projects.


### 2. How to Qualify
To qualify for the Pizza Pets Airdrop Partnership, projects must meet following criteria:

1. **Application Submission:** Projects must fill out the application on the [pets.pizza](pets.pizza) website.
2. **Active Project:** The project must be distributed and trading on marketplaces, with an active community and social media presence.
3. **Network Fees:** The project must agree to cover the airdrop/inscription fees *for their allocation*, which is around 665 to 3,325 sats (at 10-50 sats/vbyte) or $0.40 to $2.00 for each Pet.
4. **Additional Requirement (Meet One)**
